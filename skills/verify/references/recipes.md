# Project verification recipes

Use this guidance when the user requests a reusable verification recipe, or when an existing project recipe supports the current check. Ordinary verification does not require creating a recipe. Prefer extending a relevant maintained guide or harness over introducing another skill.

## Discover the real path

Inspect repository instructions, documented commands, existing harnesses, and the user-facing behavior to be covered. Establish the prerequisites, supported interface, expected result, and isolation strategy from actual sources. Do not invent selectors, ports, credentials, or startup commands. If an essential prerequisite cannot be established, record that gap instead of providing runnable-looking placeholders.

Locate an existing verification guide before choosing a destination. For requested creation, use the user's destination or the repository's established documentation convention. For an explicitly requested project-local skill, use the active host location and authoring guidance in [active host guidance](../../pancake/references/host-runtime.md). Never write into the installed plugin cache or global skills directory to configure a project. Preserve existing user content when updating a recipe.

## Keep the recipe reproducible

Include only what another agent or colleague needs to execute it cold.

- Prerequisites and scope. Name the environment, relevant tool versions, required test data, and behavior covered. Reference secret storage without recording secret values.
- Launch and readiness. Give inspected commands and an observable readiness check. For a short-lived CLI or library check, describe invocation rather than inventing a service lifecycle.
- Drive and assert. Name the user action or supported call, concrete inputs, and expected observable result. Include consequential failure cases. Use stable interface handles where available.
- Evidence. Specify what connects the action to the outcome and where artifacts survive cleanup. Distinguish test isolation from production integrations deliberately left unexercised.
- Cleanup. Track and remove only processes and scratch state created by the run. Preserve unrelated work and retained evidence, including on a failed attempt.

Use exact commands only when verified or clearly marked as unverified. Document working directories and environment overrides when required. If a helper genuinely removes repeated fragile work, create it only within authorized file scope, document its invocation, and execute it. Do not create feature maps, placeholder directories, or scripts solely to match a template.

## Prove and maintain it

Execute the recipe through the real relevant interface in an isolated environment when permitted. Verify at least the primary documented path and its cleanup. State the revision or application state exercised. Inspect retained evidence after teardown. Broader coverage claims require exercising the corresponding cases; one successful path does not prove all features.

If a prerequisite prevents execution, deliver the recipe as a draft with the specific unverified steps. Do not change product code or broaden permissions to make the recipe pass. Distinguish incorrect recipe instructions from a product failure and an environment limitation. Repair recipe errors within requested scope and rerun affected steps. Report product failures rather than rewriting the expected outcome to match them.

When using an existing recipe, check relevant commands and assumptions against the current project before relying on it. Update a saved recipe only when requested or already authorized. Report changed behavior and verification gaps instead of silently maintaining documentation outside the task. Return the recipe location, covered paths, actual results, and remaining limitations. Saving a recipe does not authorize committing or publishing it.
